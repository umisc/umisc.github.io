#### Purposes:

- Expand the club's brand image
- Provide information about the club and how to join
- Provide information about all MISC events

### Development and Maintenance

The website is a static site built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) which is based on [React](https://www.reactjs.org/) and uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to access data.

## üöÄ Quick start

Clone the repository. The rest of this guide will assume you are in the root of the repository.

1. **Install the Gatsby CLI**

```bash
yarn global add gatsby-cli

# or
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

2. **Install packages**

```bash
yarn install

# or
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server**

```
yarn develop

# or
npm run develop
```

A hot-reloading development environment should now be accessible at `localhost:8000`.

## üì¶ Deployment

Deployment to GitHub pages is easy with the help of `gh-pages`. Install the `gh-pages` package:

```bash
yarn global add gh-pages

# or
npm install -g gh-pages
```

Then, in the project's root directory

```bash
yarn deploy

# or
npm run deploy
```

It might take a while to build (because of all the images).

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains modules used and is created when you run `yarn install` or `npm install`.

2.  **`/static`**: Contains files that will be copied to the root of the `/public` build directory. Use this for linking files hosted on the website.

3.  **`/src`**: Contains most of the stuff needed to build the website.

    1. **`components`**: Contains `.js` files all of which export a React component that will probably be used in a file in either `pages` or `templates` or both.

    2. **`templates`**: Contains `.js` files all of which export a React component that will probably be used to generate pages (see the bit on `gatsby-node.js`).

    3. **`images`**: Contains images and other assets.

    4. **`pages`**: Contains the static pages (React components). Each page is automatically loaded by Gatsby and turned into a route on the website. For example, the `index.js` file in the `pages` directory exports a React component that will render on the route `/index`.

    5. **`posts`**: Contains folders which themselves contain a markdown file (and any other assets used by said markdown file) which will get built into a route using the `blog-post.js` template in `templates`. The naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title` should be used for subdirectories.

    6. **`events`**: Contains folders which themselves contain a markdown file (and any other assets used by said markdown file) which will get built into a route using the `event-post.js` template in `templates`. Naming convention same as above. Take a look at the existing directories to see how to add new events to the website.

    7. **`styles`**: Contains [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) files as well as standard CSS files. These files need to be imported by the component/template/page that uses them. E.g. at the top of the `blog-template.js` file, there is an `import '../styles/blog.sass'` statement.

4.  **`content/gallery`**: This folder contains all the club pictures loaded into the gallery page. Add new pictures here.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. This does not do a lot at the moment.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where site (metadata) like the site title and description is specified, and where Gatsby plugins can be include from. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. Current usage of this file includes building pages from the markdown files in the `posts` directory.
